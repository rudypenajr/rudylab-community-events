###### Section - MongoLab & Drywall Setup

Based on the instruction I followed, I was instructed to copy the repo from Drywall. The proper thing to do was to probably fork the repo and work from there. Despite that, I changed the remote on my branch to point to this repo rather than the Drywall repo.

Most difficult item in the setup of MongoLab and Drywall was the integration of gmail. You will have to go into your gmail account and start allowing two-step verification. This should completely solve any issues if you are unable to receive the e-mail when submitting the Forget Password form.
